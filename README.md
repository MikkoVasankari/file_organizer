## file_organizer
File organizer to sort out files in given directory/folder.
Currently organizes .txt / .png and .jpg files to appropriate directory to them.

Should work with ```cargo run your/directory/path/here```


### TODO
    - Check file extension more efficiently (maybe match?) 
    - Add more working file extension

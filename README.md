## file_organizer
File organizer to sort out files in given directory/folder.

Currently organizes .txt / .png and .jpg files to appropriate directory to them.

Should work with ```cargo run /your/directory/path/here```


### TODO
    - Check if directory already exits and add files there.
    - Check file extension more efficiently.
    - Add more working file extensions.
